The idea and desire to code had been living in me for quite some time at this point, so i just did it. I even stood up and quit my former job, in order for me to make space and time in my life for learning how to code. It all started with the [#100daysofcode](https://twitter.com/_100daysofcode) hashtag : the goal is to keep coding everyday and post one’s daily report on Twitter, for accountability.
